## Background

I was born and raised in San Francisco, California. I grew up spending lots of time in nature whether that was playing sports or hiking. I fell in love with the outdoors at a young age and have been passionate about the environment ever since!

## Education

I currently attend UCSB, where I am pursuing a degree in Environmental Studies. In the fall of my junior year I studied abroad in Chile at the Pontificia Universidad de Chile, where I learned about socio-ecological sustainability and practiced my Spanish, while being immersed in a new culture, and exploring new landscapes.
