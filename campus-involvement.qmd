## UCSB Associated Students Department of Public Worms

As one of a team of "worm wranglers" I attend to the Edible Campus Program student farm as well as help with operations of our compost piles. We aim to create a closed loop food system by growing organic produce at the farm, donating this produce to the A.S. Food Bank to be distributed to students, and collecting and composting food scraps from the dining halls and campus housing to create rich compost that can be utilized to nourish our crops. 

### Compost!
