I assisted a PhD candidate in research mosquito populations in the Eastern Sierra Nevada and how human activity drives mosquito density. We spent six weeks in the back country collecting mosquito samples from 20 lakes within eight different basins. We sorted mosquitoes to find females that had taken a recent blood meal in order to determine host species. Our results depict a declining mosquito abundance with increasing distance from trailheads and that humans, as a host population play a main role in contributing to increasing mosquito density.

## Figure 1. Blood Meal Results
Hover over data for details! This figure shows the DNA blood meal results for mosquito host species at our lake sample sites. Lake distance from trail head increases on the x-axis.
